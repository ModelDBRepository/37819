NOTE:
Simulation replicated directly from M. Bazhenov's C++ file.

Cortical SU cells are getting too little stimulation; I was unable to
find the parameter discrepancy that accounted for this.

This simulation takes a couple of minutes to run on a 800 MHz Pentium
III mswin pc.

20120112 cad.mod and gababS.mod updated to use derivimplicit and cnexp
in place of euler and cadecay.mod switched to derivimplicit as per
http://www.neuron.yale.edu/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=592

20140310 tcifb.mod updated to be compatible with most recent
developers version of neuron (1027) which requires functions in C to
be called with the same number of arguments with which the function is
declared.  A net_send() call had a flag parameter added to it to
satisfy this. The results of the auto-launch demo simulation are
unchanged.
